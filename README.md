# Blackjack Game

This project contains a simple implementation of a Blackjack game using JavaScript. It consists of three main files:

- The `script.js` file contains the main logic for the game, including starting new games/rounds, handling player actions (hit, stand), and determining winners.
- The `ui.js` file handles user interface interactions, such as displaying cards, scores, messages, and enabling/disabling buttons.
- The `blackjack.service.js` file provides services related to the rules of Blackjack game, including managing player/dealer hands, calculating scores, and determining winners.
